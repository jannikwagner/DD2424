# Exploring Neuronal Ordinary Differential Equations

### By Jannik Wagner, Katrina Liang, Niclas Popp

Neural ordinary differential equations are a class of neural networks with infinitely many layers that generalize residual networks. In this report we present the fun- damental theory behind neural ODEs together with two applications. We explain how neural ODEs can be used for descriptive time series modelling and show an example using COVID-19 infections in Sweden. Application two concerns density estimation using a family of generative models called continuous normalizing flows.
